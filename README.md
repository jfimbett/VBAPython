# Intro to VBA and Python (10 x 3 hours)

This workspace contains Quarto Reveal.js slide decks for a 10-day introductory course.

- 3 sessions VBA
- 7 sessions Python

All decks share the theme in `styles.css` at the repo root.

## Folders

- `slides/vba/` — VBA decks (Sessions 1–3)
- `slides/python/` — Python decks (Sessions 1–7)
- `exercises/` — Per-session exercises with separate solutions
- `code/` — Example code: `code/vba/*.bas`, `code/python/*.py`
- `data/` — Course data (e.g., `tickers-top20-us.csv`, `prices-top20.csv`)

## Datasets

- `data/tickers-top20-us.csv` — list of 20 largest US companies (tickers)
- `data/prices-top20.csv` — generated by the helper script below (daily close)

To fetch recent prices (optional):

```
# In your Python environment with yfinance installed
python code\python\fetch_prices.py
```

## Using the VBA code modules

- In Excel: Developer → Visual Basic → File → Import File, choose a `.bas` from `code/vba/`

## Rendering and where to find outputs

After rendering, Quarto writes HTML into the `_site/` folder. So a deck like `slides/vba/01-intro-vba.qmd` becomes `_site/slides/vba/01-intro-vba.html`.

If you want to preview or render a specific deck on Windows (cmd), run from the repo root (optional):

```
quarto preview slides\vba\01-intro-vba.qmd
quarto preview slides\python\01-setup-env.qmd
```

To render to static HTML instead of preview (optional):

```
quarto render slides\vba\01-intro-vba.qmd --to revealjs
```

Then open the result from `_site/`, for example:

```
_site\slides\vba\01-intro-vba.html
```

Or open the static landing page:

```
_site\index.html
```

Note: Ensure Quarto is installed and available on PATH.

## Next steps

- The slides and exercises are English‑only and streamlined (no speaker notes). If you want richer finance datasets or specific tickers, tell me and I’ll wire them in.
