## Two paths to apps

- Flask: micro web framework (routes, templates)
- Streamlit: UI for data apps with minimal code

---

## Flask: hello app

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

## Flask: routes and params

```python
@app.get("/greet/<name>")
def greet(name):
    return f"Hi {name}!"
```

---

## Flask: templates (Jinja2)

- Render HTML with variables and loops
- Keep logic in Python, presentation in templates

---

## Flask: forms and JSON

- request.form, request.json
- Return jsonify for APIs

---

## Streamlit: hello app

```python
import streamlit as st
st.title("Hello Streamlit")
name = st.text_input("Name")
st.write(f"Hi {name}")
```

---

## Streamlit: widgets

- sliders, selectbox, file_uploader
- instant feedback loop

---

## Streamlit: caching

```python
@st.cache_data
def load_data(path):
    ...
```

---

## Deploying

- Flask: gunicorn + reverse proxy
- Streamlit: Streamlit Cloud or container

---

## Security basics

- Never trust user input; validate and sanitize
- Hide secrets via env variables

---

## Exercise 1

- Flask endpoint that sums two numbers from query params

---

## Exercise 2

- Streamlit app that uploads a CSV and shows summary stats

---

## Real‑life analogy

- Flask = build your kitchen from scratch
- Streamlit = plug‑and‑play kitchen kit

---

## Wrap‑up

- You can create basic web/data apps quickly
- Next: Big data with Polars and Dask

---

## Flask: blueprints

- Modularize routes for larger apps

---

## Streamlit: state

```python
if "n" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.n = 0
```

---

## Deployment gotchas

- Timeouts, static files, CORS

---

## Knowledge check (quiz)

- When pick Streamlit over Flask?
- One security practice for secrets?
