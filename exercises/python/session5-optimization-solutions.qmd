```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import optimize as opt

np.random.seed(0)
mu = np.array([0.10,0.12,0.08])
Sigma = np.array([[0.04,0.01,0.00],[0.01,0.05,0.02],[0.00,0.02,0.09]])
N = len(mu)

def variance(w):
    return w @ Sigma @ w

cons = ({"type":"eq","fun": lambda w: np.sum(w)-1},
        {"type":"ineq","fun": lambda w: w})

w0 = np.ones(N)/N
res = opt.minimize(variance, w0, constraints=cons, bounds=[(0,1)]*N)
print(res.x)
